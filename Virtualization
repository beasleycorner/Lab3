1. Leveraging Resources with Virtualization 
 

   a. Create a heading in the lab readme.md file: Virtualization (Done here)
 

   b. Explain the following: 
 

      i. What types of problems are solved with virtualization? 
       There four major types of virtualization: data; desktop; server; and operating system. It lets you 
       create useful IT services using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. It allows you to 
       use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.
       Some of the types of problems you can have virtualization help with are VM sprawl, network congestion, 
       server hardware failures, reduced VM performance.

     ii. What role does hypervisor play in virtualization? 
        A hypervisor is a process that separates a computer’s operating system and applications from the 
        underlying physical hardware. Usually done as software although embedded hypervisors can be created 
        for things like mobile devices.

   c. You have two options for this portion of the module: See attachments
